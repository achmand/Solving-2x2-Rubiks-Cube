# Solving a 2x2 Rubik's Cube using C#

## Introduction 

The Rubik’s 2x2x2 solver project allows you to play/solve a pocket cube inside a program. By using the buttons and drop down menus on the form, you can rotate the cube and change its colors. Once you click on solve the instructions would be shown in the list box located on the right side of the form. You must think of the cube in a 2-dimensional way, because this is how it is displayed in the program.
